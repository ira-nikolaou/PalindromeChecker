# PalindromeChecker
Programme that determines whether or not a number is a palindrome.

"A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed."  Examples of palindromic numbers are 1234321, 777, 1 and 66.  This Java application determines whether or not a number is a palindrome.
The programme accepts one argument from the end user.  A valid argument is a number in the range 1 to 999999999 (inclusive).  An appropriate error message is displayed in each of the following situations:
- the user does not supply an argument, 
- the format of the user input (supplied as the argument) is incorrect and
- the input value provided (for a value supplied as the argument) is outside the desired range.
